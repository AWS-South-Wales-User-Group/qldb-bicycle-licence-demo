      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

Next you can create your own synthetic bicycle licence data, add and remove penalty points and change contact details. You can also delete the record. At any point you can view the history of a specific record, showing all revisions that have been made in chronological order.      ."
